### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

A small report. You can find the format for this report in the REPORT.md file. In this report, you must explain your reasoning for the number of if statements used, as well as any ideas you do not know how to implement, but you believe to be possible, on how to reduce the number of if statements in the code.

  For coding challenge #2, I included seven 'if' statements and one 'else' statement. The first 'if' statement was used to first and foremost compare the Systolic and Diastolic pressure from the patient's input and disifer whether it would continue to run through the rest of the code or be printed as an Error. The next statement used was an 'else' statement to compare all the other 'if' statements that would follow after depending on if the numbers passed or not. The second 'if' statement is used to identify if the blood pressure is considered normal by identifying and contrasting both the Systolic and Diastolic pressure numbers. The thrid 'if' statement is similar to how the blood pressure is measured except this is to dertermine if there is an elevated blood pressure. The fourth 'if' statement determines if the numbers inputted mean Stage 1 Hypertension by running the Systolic and Diastolic pressure numbers, this time through an "or" instead of an "and" scenario. The fifth 'if' statement works the same way as the previous statement except this statement identifies if the numbers mean Stage 2 Hypertension. As for the last two 'if' statements (six & seven), they work together in a sense that they use the 'and/or' scenario to identify and label the numbers as Hypertensive Crysis if they pass through this specific statement.
  Looking back on my code, I feel like I could have shrunken the 'if' statements to four or less 'if' statements if I knew how to execute that challenge. Before I ended up with seven 'if' statements, I previously had around 14 of those statements but tweaked and played around with it for a little and it shrunk down to 7. Yet I feel like I could shrink it even more by combining statements that possibly don't need seperating into other 'if' statements and going from there. For example, to use one 'if' statement and simply list the possible numbers with relational opperators (as shown in the code) and treat them like switch statements if possible. The switch statements would allow me to have multiple cases and which in this code would allow me to label each case as Normal, Elevated, Stage 1 Hypertension, Stage 2 Hypertension, and so forth.
